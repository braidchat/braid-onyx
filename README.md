# braid-onyx

An work-in-progress Onyx application to do useful things for Braid.
Currently, its purpose is to monitor the Datomic log and send messages content to ElasticSearch to facilitate better search for Braid.

This is still a work-in-progress, instructions on use will be added when things are actually working.
